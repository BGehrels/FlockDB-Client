A FlockDB Java Client
Copyright 2012 Benjamin Gehrels

It is based on the FlockDB Thrift API originally developed by Robey Pointer, Nick Kallen, Ed Ceaser and John Kalucki at
Twitter.

Thrift is originally developed by Mark Slee, Aditya Agarwal and Marc Kwiatkowski at Facebook. It is now a project of the
Apache Software Foundation.

The build process uses the Thrift Maven Plugin by David Trott.

The test code makes intensive use of Hamcrest (http://www.hamcrest.org) as an easy way to get beautiful troubleshooting
output for failing tests.
